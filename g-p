To install Gnumeric on RHEL 7, you'll need to follow a few steps, as it is not available in the default RHEL repositories. Below are the steps you can follow:

### 1. **Enable the EPEL Repository**

The Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository provides additional software packages, though Gnumeric isn't directly available in EPEL, enabling EPEL is still a good practice as it provides dependencies.

```bash
sudo yum install epel-release
```

### 2. **Install Required Dependencies**

Before installing Gnumeric, you might need to install several dependencies manually:

```bash
sudo yum install goffice goffice-devel libgsf libgsf-devel gtk2 gtk2-devel
```

### 3. **Download Gnumeric RPM**

Since Gnumeric is not directly available in the RHEL 7 repositories, you'll need to find an RPM package compatible with RHEL 7. You can download Gnumeric RPM from a reliable third-party repository such as [PKGS.org](https://pkgs.org) or [Fedora Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/).

Example command to download an RPM from a URL:

```bash
wget http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/Packages/gnumeric-1.12.50-2.el7.x86_64.rpm
```

### 4. **Install the RPM Package**

After downloading the RPM package, install it using `yum`:

```bash
sudo yum localinstall gnumeric-1.12.50-2.el7.x86_64.rpm
```

This command will also handle installing any remaining dependencies.

### 5. **Verify the Installation**

Once installed, you can verify the installation by running:

```bash
gnumeric --version
```

This command should output the version of Gnumeric that was installed.

### Troubleshooting

- **Missing Dependencies**: If `yum` reports missing dependencies, you'll need to download and install those manually or look for them in the EPEL or other repositories.
  
- **Using Alternatives**: If you can't find a suitable RPM, consider using alternatives like LibreOffice for spreadsheet manipulation or Python libraries like `pandas`.

### Summary

Installing Gnumeric on RHEL 7 requires a bit of manual effort, including downloading the correct RPM and ensuring all dependencies are met. If you face any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
